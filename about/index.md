#About Me

I have been programming in one way or another since 1995.  I began to program back in the mid 80′s when I started Junior High.  And I did it on an Apple, my trusty Apple ][e.  I ran a great little BBS for a few years back then as well. In high school, programming took a backseat along with just about everything else.

After a brief stint running my own Jet Ski shop and race team,  I began working full-time for my dad.  He ran one of the biggest and successful Sporting Goods distributors in the country. As the world wide web began to gain traction, I began writing a website for the company. In the mid 90′s we launched the first B2B e-commerce websites in our industry.

As the website became successful and began to genereate business, I began writing the company's internal software as well.  By the year 2000, the company was running on a web-based system before they were called web apps.  The tools I wrote went on to power the company for over 15 years and produce millions of dollars in business.

I amv now the Director of Technology and Lead Developer at Worldmedia Interactive, a Digital Agency in Miami where we work with some of the largest major airlines and cruise lines among other clients.  I am enjoying the fast pace of the Digital Media industry and thrilled to be building the next generation of tools, websites and apps.

On a personal level, I have a wonderful wife who puts up with me on a computer, cell phone and/or lap top almost 24/7, 3 incredible kids who are already showing interest in computers and programming.  I live in South Florida, but love to travel and I look forward to finding new opportunities to share my knowledge.
