#About Me
##Front End Engineer

I have been programming in one way or another since 1995.  I began to program back in the mid 80′s in Junior High on my trusty Apple ][e.  I ran a nice little BBS for a few years back then too.  In high school, programming took a backseat along with just about everything else.  After a brief stint running my own Jet Ski shop and race team,  I began working full-time for my dad.  He ran one of the biggest and successful Sporting Goods distributors in the country.  As the internet began to get popular, I began writing websites for the company.  I wrote a few more early on, some even for paying customers.  In the mid 90′s we launched the first B2B e-commerce websites in our industry.

After writing the websites, I began writing the company's Intranet.  By the year 2000, it was running on a fully custom web-based system before they were called web app was.  That web app went on to power the company for over 15 years and millions of dollars of business.

I am now the Associate Director of Technology and Lead Developer at Worldmedia Interactive, a Digital Agency in Miami which handles the media advertising for some major airlines and cruise lines among other clients.  I am enjoying the fast pace of the Digital Media industry and thrilled to be building the next generation of tools, websites and apps.

On a personal level, I have a wonderful wife who puts up with me on a computer, cell phone and/or lap top almost 24/7, 3 incredible kids who are already showing interest in computers and programming.  I live in South Florida, but love to travel and I look forward to finding new opportunities to share my knowledge.
