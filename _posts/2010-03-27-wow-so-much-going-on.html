<p>I have been closing the loose ends on a ton of projects. I have the following coming soon.
<a href="http://webtocatalog.com" target="_blank">webtocatalog.com</a> is up and running. - Create a print catalog for your ecommerce site. We have a catalog for valorcorp.com going to press next week generated on w2c.</p>
<p>Ecommerce platform coming - I have had an ecommerce platform up and running a couple of sites for friends for years. I have begun updating them and getting them ready to rol out to anybody. Watch for it.</p>
<p>Blulyne Group - I have started a new company to tie all these together. <a href="http://blulyne.com" target="_blank">blulyne.com</a>. Watch this site for updates and exciting things to come.</p>
<p>I also have a little side project for the iphone and ipad that is pretty interesting too.. Â More to come.</p>
