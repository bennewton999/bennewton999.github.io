<p><img style="border: 0; margin: 0 0 5px 5px;" src="http://bennewton.us/files/2007/08/mac.jpg" alt="mac" width="75" height="90" align="left" border="0" />I made my first trip to an Apple Store this past weekend.  Big Mistake. I don't want to like the nice smooth, clean, simple lap tops.  I didn't want to see that the iPhone actually is as nice as it looks in commercials.  I didn't need to know that the iMac has grown up and is a real computer now rivaling any PC.  There were so many things I have basically ignored over the past few years.  Being a long, long time Windows user and programmer, I have all but ignored the Apple revolution.  I have used them, but always with a slanted view.   I was always looking at the limits, but they seem to be gone now..
There were a few things that really caught my attention.   First I'll cover my thoughts on the products.  I will be writing another post about the customer service, which is just a step above everybody.</p>
<h4><strong>1. iPhone</strong></h4>
<p><a href="http://bennewton.us/files/2007/08/cp-ipod-iphone-070629.gif"><img src="http://bennewton.us/files/2007/08/cp-ipod-iphone-070629-thumb.gif" alt="cp_ipod_iphone_070629" align="right" /></a> First, let me say I was not impressed with all the <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">iPhone</a> hype.  I have a Cingular 8525 that I am still happy with.  I didn't even consider the iPhone.  Then I used one.  Damn it...  I want one now.  I think I can overcome this urge though.  Like I said I am happy with my 8525, even though it compares to the iPhone like an Atari 2600 compares to a Wii. (but a real fast 2600 ;).  I also am devising a plan to make my wife really want one so I can get it for her as a gift.. (I hope she doesn't read this.</p>
<h4>2. iMac</h4>
<p><a href="http://bennewton.us/files/2007/08/cp-mac-imac-070807.gif"><img src="http://bennewton.us/files/2007/08/cp-mac-imac-070807-thumb.gif" alt="cp_mac_imac_070807" align="right" /> This</a> is just a slick computer now.  I have a couple of the older ones floating around.  My daughter has one of the large and clunky one and I never really have used it.  I also have one at work on a shelf that has the bowl turned upside down base with a monitor on an arm sticking out.  Nice, but again, never really used it.</p>
<h4>3. MacBook</h4>
<p><a href="http://bennewton.us/files/2007/08/cp-mac-macbook-070611.gif"><img src="http://bennewton.us/files/2007/08/cp-mac-macbook-070611-thumb.gif" alt="cp_mac_macbook_070611" width="148" height="75" align="right" /> Here's</a> where they hooked me.  What a sweet setup.  Small, powerful, full of useful software, built in camera, fast, shiny.. Wow they really did hook me.  Now I tried to make the switch a few years back and just couldn't hack it.  There was too much software I needed for windows.  I have a powerbook G4 that I just could never get used to.  I don't know if this will be the case now.  There is actually software out there now that I want that is only available for the mac..  What?  I never thought that would happen.</p>
<p>My wife swears by her G5s.  She doesn't like using anything windows.  So now I have to eat crow for the last 5 or 6 years of getting on her Mac every chance I got.  Now I just can't do it anymore.  There is nothing to make fun of.  Since I started on a Apple ][e, I guess I will be coming full circle.</p>
<p>If you haven't been to an <a href="http://www.apple.com/retail/">Apple Store</a> yet, I highly recommend it.  It is quite an experience to see this much excitement around computers and gadgets.</p>
<p>Any of you have any experiences good or bad switching from a pc to a mac?  Tell me your stories in the comments.</p>
