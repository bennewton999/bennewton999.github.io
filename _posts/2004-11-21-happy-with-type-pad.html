<p>I'm happy with type pad and I think I have some ideas on how I am going to divide this up. I will have random thoughts, as all blogs do. But I will try to devote as much info to online shopping, commerce website development etc as I can. I will add a category for <a href="http://talk.valorcorp.com/ControlPanel/Blogs/www.valorcorp.com" target="_blank">Valor's website</a> additions and fixes.
I have been busy over the last week and I hope to get to this almost everyday. I wil still rome the Forums, but I will post anything new here and link to anything interesting in the Forum. Keep coming back! It should get interesting.</p>
