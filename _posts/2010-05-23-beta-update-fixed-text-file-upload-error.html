<p>First, I’d like to thank all of you for testing the site. Your feedback is much appreciated. Please keep it coming.</p>
<p>I have updated the inventory upload to work with more files. There are more variations of these files than I thought. For the best results, use a tab delimited text file or xls spread sheet. XML is not supported yet, so no Yahoo Shopping cart files yet.</p>
<p>If you ran into an error this week, please come back and try again.</p>
<p>If you would like to have your catalog made for you and you will allow us to use it in demos, please email me at ben@blulyne.com and include your inventory file.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
