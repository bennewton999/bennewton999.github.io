<p>After growing up in South Florida and never seeing a real hurricane even get close until Andrew, I am now shuttered up ad ready for my 8th hurricane in 15 months.  Let me say that I am tired of Hurricanes.  The thought of moving out of state does not seem so far off any more.  The stress of knowing that a killer storm is going to come somewhere near you, for at least seven days now, is nauseating.  Any way I will post more if I keep my electricity.  Maybe some photos tomorrow.</p>
