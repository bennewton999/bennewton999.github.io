<p>What is this country coming to?  A man in Arkansas has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/04/20/xm-hit-with-false-advertising-lawsuit-over-commercial-free-cla/">brought a suit against XM Radio</a> for false advertising.  I happen to have XM in my truck and, though I don't listen to it all the time, I can say that the music is basically commercial free.  Yes, the DJ may mention what is coming up on another channel, but I wouldn't call that a commercial.  This is just splitting hairs.  What ever happened to taking your product back if you were unsatisfied with it.  Instead, this guy is going to cost them thousands, if not 10's or 100's of thousands in legal fees and guess who gets to pony up the bill.  That's right, the humble customer like you and me that can stomach 10 seconds of a DJ talking between songs.  Get a life!  Quit costing us more and wasting the court's time on such frivolous items.</p>
