<p>I finally broke down and got a <a href="http://www.cingular.com/cell-phone-service/cell-phone-details/?q_list=true&amp;q_phoneName=Cingular+8525&amp;q_sku=sku310005" target="_blank">cinular 8525 phone</a>.  I am having mixed feelings now that I have it.  The first two weeks I didn't sync up with my exchange from work because I thought it would haunt me 24 hours a day.  Then I left on vacation last week up to North Carolina and gave in and had the phone sync to my exchange mailbox before I left.  Well, my worst fears have come true.  I am checking my mail way too often.  Since I get well over 500 emails a day, there is always something new to look at.  Driving on the <a href="http://www.blueridgeparkway.org/" target="_blank">Blue Ridge Parkway</a> and checking my email doesn't make my wife happy either.  Truth is, though it forms terrible habits, I don't know how I lived without the phone.
Another great feature I don't know how I lived without is the data modem feature.  I have tethered the phone to my laptop and I am now using it for my internet connection.  (<a href="http://pocketpccentral.net/help/cingular/8525_usb_modem.htm" target="_blank">Thanks Pocket PC Central</a>)  See, here at my inlaws' there is just a cable modem I don't feel like fumbling with.  So, unless I want to steal a neighbor's unsecure wireless link, I'm without the internet for 4 days.  Now, I realize a vacation should be just that, but I can't function without it at this point.  I think I need help.  Any way, the phone has worked flawlessly.  I have had a great signal all the way up I-95 from South Florida to North Carolina.  3G in more places than I thought I would have it.  I was even able to use the phone to download the drivers for my laptop that I forgot to bring with me.</p>
<p>If you are addicted to your email or can't go long without web access, this phone is a must for you.</p>
