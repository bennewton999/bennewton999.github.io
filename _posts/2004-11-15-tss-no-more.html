<p>For those of you that are techies and watch TechTV, now G4,  the long running show, The Screen Savers, is dieing a slow death.  This show has been a staple on my Tivo for over a year now and I have been watching it on and off for at least 4 years. Although now a days, it is rare to find a good tip, in the old days, this show would inspire some great ideas, and was always a source for good freeware ideas and tips.
Now, bought recently by G4 TV, the video game network, the show is losing most of it's staff and on air personalities. The network specializes in video games and unfortunately, they can't seem to have an hour of actual computer talk on the air.</p>
<p>This show introduced me to blogs over a year ago and I ignored it as a fad. And here I am a year later getting my blog off the ground and rediscovering the web all over again.</p>
<p>Thanks TSS.</p>
