<p><img class="alignnone" title="Macbook" src="http://bensbrain.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/step2_beautyshot_mbblk_060509.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="129" />Yes, that's right, I took the plunge and went to my <a href="http://www.apple.com">new favorite store</a> and bought a MacBook. I got the Black Mac with 2gig of ram. I have to say, I am totally impressed with this machine.
I owned one other PowerBook G4 in the past, but ended up never using it. There were too many compatibility issues and I just didn't like it. So why did I go back to Apple again? This computer works. Simple as that. I don't need any accessories. It has the built in isight, which me and my son made a cute little video with yeserday on te first try. With my windows laptop, it was just not that simple.</p>
<p>I haven't rally had time to mess around with much else, but I have my email, installed <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">twitteriffic</a> and hopefully will be able to get it to work tethered to my Cingular 8525 for mobile internet connection if necesarry. If that doesn't work, it won't be the end of the world since this computer also seems to have the bes wirelees integration of any of my past lap tops too. My Toshiba doesn't ever want to work out of sight of our WAP. I can work at our dining room table with this one.</p>
<p>I will write more as I have more experiences with it. My only advice now is, if you don't want to part with the $$, don't visit an Apple Store.</p>
