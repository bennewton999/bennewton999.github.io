<p>With beta testing ready to get going, we have invited many of you to set up your account and download a product template so you can have your products ready.  Though you can still use the template, I am happy to announce you can use any other excel sheet too.  After uploading your inventory spread sheet, you will have the oppurtunity to map the fields in your new catalog to the fields in your excel sheet.</p>
<p>This will enable you to use Amazon feeds, Yahoo feeds and more.</p>
<p>Keep watching.  The beta will open to everyone any day now.</p>
