It's not hard to add one of your walls to your Facebook Page. Â With the new iframe tabs they allow you to add, it's rather simple.</p>
<p>So what can you do with a vital wall on your Facebook Page?</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a Live Top List of Products on your site</li>
<li>Put a "Window" in your shop and show the images of viewed products as they are viewed by other customers or as they are added to a cart.</li>
<li>Have a top list of the last # hour's top blog posts viewed.</li>
</ul>
<div>I will put up a video shortly of how to add a vital wall to your facebook page.</div>
