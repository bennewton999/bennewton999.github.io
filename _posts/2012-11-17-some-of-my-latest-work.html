<div>I will probably never really get around to redesigning it, so for right now I just wanted to share some of my latest work I am doing at Worldmedia Interactive.  For those of you who don't know, I am the lead developer there now and work with a great bunch of folks.  I will come back and fill you in on the details of where the cool features are that I am most proud of and how we pulled some of them off, but for now, here's some links.</div>

<p>Paradisus Resorts Romance Microsite (I'll put a link when they launch it)</p>
<p>NCL Breakaway Mobile Site (Hope they launch soon too)</p>
<p>LAN Airlines Mobile Landing Page (Have to find this link)</p>
<p>What am I currently working on?</p>
<p>Internal Portal for a large client (more when it's live),  Paradisus Resorts Wedding Tools, a new Section for the NCL Breakaway Microsite and more.</p>
<p>I'm doing some pretty cool in house apps with Node.js too, I will share some of my experience with Node here as well.  There's much more and I am going to do what I can to really keep this up to date.  We are doing some amazing things at Worldmedia Interactive and I want to share them with you.  I will try to keep this more up to date.</p>
