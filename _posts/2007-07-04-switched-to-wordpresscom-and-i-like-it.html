<p><span class="sbmLink"><span class="sbmLink"><a href="http://www.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"><img style="margin: 0 0 10px 10px; border: 0;" src="http://bennewton.us/files/2007/07/wordpress-logo.png" alt="wordpress-logo" width="250" height="68" align="right" border="0" /></a>Well, I have made my 3rd switch of blogging platforms.  I started with  <a href="http://www.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Typepad.com</a> about two and a half years ago.  It was good, but not worth the $$ for a personal blog written for fun and not for profit.  I liked the simplicity at the time, but was looking for something with more potential for customization.</span></span>
<span class="sbmLink"><span class="sbmLink">So I switched to <a href="http://communityserver.org/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Community Server</a> about a year later.  I moved <a href="http://talk.valorcorp.com" target="_blank">Valor's Forums and Blogs</a> to Community Server also, which I still use for them, but for my personal blog, I never was comfortable with it.  So much so, I basically stopped posting.  When I did post, I could never get <a href="http://www.tecnorati.com" target="_blank">Technorati.com</a> pings to work etc.  It has worked great for Valor's Blog, but I may move that soon too.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="sbmLink"><span class="sbmLink">And now, I'm using <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Wordpress.com</a>.  I have to say, so far I am very happy.  They have definitely made some changes since I last looked at it.  I never realized how many of the blogs I read are Wordpress blogs.  It's a great site.  Simple and clean.  As you can see, I am using the default theme and I don;t see any reason to change it.  I will put up a custom header at some point, but this will work for now.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="sbmLink"><span class="sbmLink">So subscribe to my feed if you're interested.  I have some interesting projects I am working on and will begin to introduce them here in the near future.  And I will start spewing useless and not so useless info here almost daily now. </span></span></p>
