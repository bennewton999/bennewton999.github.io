<p>When beginning your start up, you have to save every penny. So, smart entrepreneurs search high and low for the cheapest alternatives to the expensive services out there they need to use to get going.
In this article, I will show you six web apps I am using now at <a href="http://blulyne.com/blog">blulyne.com</a>. Some are so good, I will continue to use them long after I have the opportunity to easily switch to the paid version. If you're going into business for yourself, at least one of these apps should be a nice help to get you off on a positive note.</p>
<h2><strong>Mail Chimp</strong></h2>
<p><a href="http://img.skitch.com/20100409-eb8y25b7pju9b5pb244p7epfur.jpg"><img class="alignright" src="http://img.skitch.com/20100409-eb8y25b7pju9b5pb244p7epfur.jpg" alt="mailchimp.com" width="167" height="201" /></a></p>
<p>In my other, established business, I use a very good web app to send mailings out to thousands of customers.</p>
<p>I have been paying monthly for it for years now. I have no complaints, because we send out mailings monthly and the financial return on the mailing is almost instant. But, with my start-up, I need to send mailings out to my customers with new feature announcements etc. There very well may be no return for the first few months on these emails. So I really didn't want to start with that other service here.</p>
<p>A quick search landed me at <a href="http://mailchimp.com">mailchimp.com</a>. They offer all the features that the more expensive service I've been using does, and the best part is, for under 500 subscribers, it is free to use. It does eventually cost something to use after you have sent out 3,000 emails, but even then it is about 1/3 the cost of the other service I am using.</p>
<p>Mailchimp.com has all the features you would expect to see from an app for sending mailings such as list management for multiple lists, html designer, built in templates and more.  They also boast some cutting edge features, such as geo-targeting and auto-translation.</p>
<p>You can't go wrong with this app and I bet you will be using it long after you are making money and sending mailings to tens of thousands of users.</p>
<h2>PHPanywhere.com</h2>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8ee/1367697940958/phpanywhere1.jpg"><img title="phpanywhere" height="216" alt="" width="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-196" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8f1/1367697940912/phpanywhere1-300x216.jpg" /></a>I have a bad habit of wanting the <a href="http://apple.com">latest and greatest</a> when it comes to computers.  So between work, home and laptops, I will get a new computer at least once a year.  This makes updating the new computer a pretty laborious but familiar task for me.  Adding apps on the computer that I have actually purchased, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, is usually not a problem, just a time waster.  This last year I switched my home computer and lap top both from Windows to Macs.  I knew I couldn't install my Dreamweaver on the computer, but I did assume I could buy an upgrade from my current windows version and just buy the Mac version.  WRONG.  Switch operating systems and you're buying a brand new version.  Well, I couldn't bring myself to spend the money.  It's just a glorified text editor.</p>
<p>So I first searched for other website tools for Macs.  There are a lot of simple editors out there, but they all want money after 30 days, and too much money in most cases.  Again, off to Google to find that free editor out there in the cloud.  That lead me to <a href="http://phpanywhere.net">PHPanywhere.net</a>.</p>
<p>This nice little web app is surprisingly full featured.  It includes FTP connections for each site, It remembers your open files, so when you come to it on another computer, it is all the same as the first.  It has a fully functional HTML editor.  This appears to be in beta still.  Their blog hasn't been updated recently.  There are some hiccups with the app, but nothing that cannot be overcome with a little trial and error.  The main thing to know when using this app is it only appears to work well in Firefox which is not the end of the world.  It may not be free forever, but for now, it beats paying for a new version of Dreamweaver.</p>
<h2>Online Photo Editor by Pixlr.com</h2>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8f4/1367697941211/pixlr.jpg"><img title="pixlr" height="125" alt="" width="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-195" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8f7/1367697940814/pixlr-300x125.jpg" /></a>Just like Dreamweaver, Photoshop is not something I want to buy for every computer I have. Fortunately, there is <a href="http://pixlr.com">Pixlr.com</a>. Pixlr.com offers a fully featured image editor completely in the cloud. On top of that, you can get a Chrome plug-in from them that allows you to easily do screen captures. Since you will likely be doing instructions in some form of your new venture, a screen grabber is a must.</p>
<h2>Google Voice</h2>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8fa/1367697942310/gvoice1.jpg"><img title="Google Voice" height="152" alt="" width="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-202" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8fd/1367697941044/gvoice1-300x152.jpg" /></a>Assuming your start-up consists of only you, <a href="http://voice.google.com">Google Voice</a> is the perfect receptionist to add to your staff.  With Google Voice you can set up a phone number for your business, have that number ring on your cell, at our house, or at your extension at your day job even (don't let your boss find out).  When you answer, you have the option to screen the call, answer it or send it to voice mail.  You can even monitor the caller leaving the voice mail and elect to answer it then.</p>
<p>Your voice mails are converted to text and can be set up to sent via SMS to your cell phone and emailed to you.  So you can stay up on what is going on even if you are in a meeting, no need to stop and listen to the message.  Your email will also contain an audio file of the message in case the conversion to text did not go well.</p>
<p>Now, if you want to use this service to call out, or you want an 800 toll free number, the service is not free, but for a start-up, it is perfect.</p>
<h2>Hootsuite</h2>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d900/1367697941632/4bcbc818cb003.jpg"><img title="4bcbc818cb003" height="148" alt="" width="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-197" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d903/1367697940922/4bcbc818cb003-300x148.jpg" /></a>The easiest way to promote your start-up is through social media.  Since you are just getting started, there may not be much to manage, but you want to be ready and available to every single mention of your brand online.  <a href="http://hootsuite.com">Hootsuite</a> allows you to easily monitor your brand and respond quickly to any mention.  You can monitor multiple Social Media accounts including Twitter and Facebook.</p>
<p>As you grow, you may not be the one to do this monitoring full time.  A new feature allows you to add other users to your account and have them monitor and post to your social media accounts.</p>
<p>There are many other web apps out there that you can use for little or no cost.  Some obvious ones are Gmail, Google Docs, but there are many others.  What are you using to save money at your start-up?</p>
