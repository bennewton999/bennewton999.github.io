<p><a title="blog_ad_660x160.jpg" href="http://bensbrain.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/blog_ad_660x160.jpg"><img src="http://bensbrain.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/blog_ad_660x160.jpg" alt="blog_ad_660x160.jpg" /></a>No, it's not anything like that...  <a href="http://MyNakedPastor.com">MyNakedPastor.com</a> is a website that my <a href="http://flamingoroadchurch.com" target="_blank">church</a> is running.  Our Pastor, <a href="http://www.troygramling.com" target="_blank">Troy Gramling</a>, has been online via webcam 24/7 for almost 3 weeks now.  There are about 2 weeks left.  It has been very interesting to watch.  From his house, to his speaking gigs, there has been a lot to see and you can quickly get the picture of what he is up to with this website.  You will see that he and the other pastors and leaders of the church are down to earth and really try to live the life they teach on the weekends, yet they struggle like you and me.
I was lucky enough to do a tiny bit of ajax work on the site for them, I hope to do more work for them in the future.  <a href="http://www.arturodelamora.com/">Arturo De La Mora </a>is the tech guy behind it.  He got to spend the first week in the house changing camera views.  Then the next week he was on a road trip to Orlando for a speaking engagement.</p>
<p>If you get a moment in the next two weeks, I highly suggest checking it out.  The 8pm "Naked Couch" segments have been the most interesting to me.  But the whole thing has been very interesting and really gives you a behind the scenes look at how one man is dedicating his life to grow Flamingo Road Church in South Florida and around the world into <em>one church where you are</em>.</p>
