<p>Well, let me welcome you to my blog. I've been hearing about these for at least a year now and never had any interest in looking at them. I mean who cares what someone's thinking..especailly someone who thinks other people want to know about it.. Then I started seeing books on blogging in the bookstore. I thought there are no books on how to write a diary. Maybe I can write a book on some simple thing we've done all along, but now we can do it on a computer. How about <em>The Electronic Post It Note, (a guide to typing on a little yellow square)</em>
Then I started messing with RSS feeds and realized that rss feeds and blogs seem to have some weird relationship. So one thing led to another and I started reading some blogs.</p>
<p>Then it dawned on me what these are all about. I new there had to be a blog in me somewhere. And it hit me. I realized if I can somehow get these random thoughts that I have late at night about what I can do to Valor's site to make it better, or to make the orders get out faster, etc., this would be the perfect place to do it. I post my thoughts and you tell me what you think. A blog! Now I get it.</p>
<p>So come back often and see what happens... Get an RSS reader.. The web's still interesting...</p>
<p>Here is an interersting article on blogs...<a href="http://www.searchenginejournal.com/index.php?p=996">http://www.searchenginejournal.com/index.php?p=996</a></p>
