<p><a href="http://scobleizer.com/">Robert Scoble</a> has a <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/07/31/the-case-of-the-missing-558-posts/">post</a> tonight where he says out of the 1,048 blog posts he shared on his link blog, only 490 came from the top 35 blogs.  Well one of the other 558 shared items was a post from this blog.  Though my blog has been around for a couple of years, I have bascially ignored it until recntly.
That <a href="/ben-newton/2007/07/20/facebook-in-my-day-we-used-email">one post</a> that ended up in his link blog via Google Reader's shared items.  It probably ended up there because I had his name in it, but he found it interesting enough to click 'share'.  It was only one of my first few posts since I started taking my blog a little more seriously.</p>
<p>This is the beauty of the blogoshpere.  If you have something interesting to say, it will get out there.  You don't have to blog for months and develop a following as it seemed to be in the past.  Google is <a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2007/07/17/instantIndexing.html">indexing blogs in minutes</a>, even seconds now.  You have something to say?  Say it.  People interested in it will hear you.</p>
