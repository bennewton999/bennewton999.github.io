<p>Workflows for front end devs are ever changing. &nbsp;A few years ago, I didn't even think about work flows. &nbsp;I used Coda, or some other text editor and FTP. &nbsp;That was it. &nbsp;Now, I have so many tools that help me with my daily tasks I don't do anything the same way anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p></p><h2>My Current Tools</h2><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/525b52d9e4b058049560a6e2/1381716697862/toolset.png" /><p>&nbsp;<a href="http://yeoman.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Yeoman</strong></a> actually consists of 3 different tools that work together to help scaffold your web apps. &nbsp;No more downloading this zip file or cloning git repos. &nbsp;With Yeoman, you can spend time writing your app and not building the same framework again and again.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/yeoman/yo" target="_blank"><strong>Yo</strong></a> scaffolds your web app, building the directory structure, adding boilerplate files etc to quickly get straight to developing. &nbsp;It also allows you to quickly build components for your app as well. You can download a <a href="http://yeoman.io/community-generators.html" target="_blank">number of different generators</a>. &nbsp;Whatever you're looking for, there is probably a generator for it.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Grunt</strong></a> is used to test and build distributions of your web app. &nbsp;It creates a server on you local dev machine that auto reloads your site as you edit files.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="http://bower.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Bower</strong></a> is a package manager, which means no more searching for and downloading zip files of this or that.</p><p>&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Sublime Text</strong></a> - I've been using this text editor for a couple of years and don't think I will be changing any time soon. &nbsp;It has a package manager that you can add which then makes adding plugins dead simple. &nbsp;Some of those plugins are listed below.</span></p><p><a href="https://sublimegit.net/" target="_blank"><strong>SublimeGit</strong></a>&nbsp; - This plugin gives you all the git tools available right in sublime, makes keeping your repo up to date and super clean. I switched from Tower to the command line to this plugin and it is by far the simplest git tool I've used yet.</p><p><a href="http://emmet.io/" target="_blank"><strong>Emmet</strong></a>&nbsp; - This plugin allows you to write a ton of code super quickly by using short codes that translate to html and css. &nbsp;Check out their page for a video.<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p><a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home" target="_blank"><strong>iTerm 2</strong></a>&nbsp;- is a Terminal replacement which focuses on performance. &nbsp;It includes features such as tabs, split screens and 256 colors. &nbsp;It's a good alternative.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><a href="http://beanstalkapp.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Beantalk</strong></a>&nbsp; - is a private git repo that I use to store and deploy all of our websites for work and personal projects. &nbsp;I have over 35 repos on beanstalk. &nbsp;They are protected and are set up to deploy to server automatically on push. It's a nice alternative to GitHub when it comes to private repos.</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Github</strong></a> - is the answer for public repos. &nbsp;github's <a href="http://github.com/trending" target="_blank">trending</a> pages are my new favorite pages to check daily.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="http://codepen.io/" target="_blank"><strong>CodePen</strong></a>&nbsp; - is a great place to try out the code &nbsp;that has been floating around in your head. &nbsp;It's great for sharing ideas and just showing off your latest css discovery. &nbsp;They now have pro accounts with some great features.</p><p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank"><strong>DropBox</strong></a>&nbsp; - Everyone knows drop box, but I have begun keeping my projects in drop box which allows me to leave work, come home and open my laptop and keep working without worrying about going to a repo.</p><h2>Tools in the Trash</h2><p>There are a few tools I thought were the thing a few months ago are now collecting virtual moth balls on my drive and I just don't need them anymore. &nbsp;Tower for git, MAMP for hosting and Coda are all tools that are just too cumbersome to use in this new workflow.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>
