<p><a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/ticketexchangehome/?tm_link=tm_exchange_header"><img style="margin: 0 0 5px 5px;" src="http://bennewton.us/files/2007/07/ticketexchange.gif" alt="ticketexchange" align="right" /></a> I have extra tickets to The Police concert tomorrow night at Dolphin Stadium.  I was going to sell them online, but I sat on them until yesterday because frankly, I didn't realize the concert was tomorrow.  I planned on selling them on <a href="http://www.stubhub.com/" target="_blank">StubHub.com</a> and found out after signing up, that it was too late to sell these tickets because the tickets have to be Fedexed to the buyer in time for the show.  Poor feature IMHO since they are sitting in my email  in .pdf format ready to be sent to anyone.
No problem, I will sell them through <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/ticketexchangehome/?tm_link=tm_exchange_header" target="_blank">Ticketmaster Ticket Exchange</a>.  I have to say I think its a nice service.  I had them up for sale in a minute or two.  Nothing to enter but the ticket id number on the pdf and set the price.  I don't have to worry about anything else. If someone buys them, they get new tickets emailed to them straight from Ticketmaster and I get paid.  Like I said, nice service.  They charge 15% of the selling price, a bit pricey, but there is literally no work involved on my end, so I really can't complain about that.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like they won't sell in time.  Either way, I am impressed with the idea of the ticket exchange website.  I will be more willing to buy tickets to an event far in advance knowing I can get rid of them relatively easily if I end up not being able to go.</p>
