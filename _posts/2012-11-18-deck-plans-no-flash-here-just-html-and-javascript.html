<p>Here is the <a href="http://breakaway.ncl.com/ship/deck-plans/#deck5" target="_blank">Deck Plans page</a>, one of the features I wrote for the <a target="_blank" href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a13e4b04b094756d909/1367697939094/#img">NCL Breakaway Website</a>. &nbsp;Keep in mind, I only did the front end&nbsp;development, not the design. &nbsp;The design goes to some great guys I work with at <a target="_blank" href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a13e4b04b094756d909/1367697939094/#img">Worldmedia Interactive</a>.
The deck images are a series of slides that I sequence through on slide of the slider. They decided after we wrote this they wanted links on the images, so we added image maps for each slide that we apply to each slide on change using javascript. The maps and slide filenames are stored in a json file that is easily updated or can eventually be tied into a CMS to get the data.</p><p>By viewing "Connecting Staterooms", you can see we toggle between two sets of images to highlight the connecting rooms. &nbsp;We added anchor tags to allow deep linking to certain decks.</p><p>After testing, NCL decide they wanted to be able to drag the deck back and forth itself, so we added a drag function to the image that corresponded with the slider. A nice quick fix.</p><p>This is a nice first step that I can see turning into a great shipboard app to get you around while your onboard. &nbsp;Hopefully, we will get a chance to write that.</p><p>What I did:
