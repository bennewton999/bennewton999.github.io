<p>I’m working on a new feature and the option of adding thousands of items if necesarry.  After seeing some of your catalog needs, I quickly realized there may be needs or large catalogs.  I have updated the code and tested it to work with large amounts of items.  I’m happy to tell you it works beautifully.  Technically, you could make a catalog that is as large as a phone book.</p>
<p>Right now, I have the ‘add catalog’ feature turned off while I do a major update to the code for image handling.  This won’t be the norm, it just happened to be a big change to the main structure of the code, so it was safer to take it down.  It will be back soon and I will update this post.</p>
<p>I promise there is a video tour coming.  I just want to get a few more features enabled before it is released.  Thanks to everybody who has already signed up.  I look forward to helping you get your products in front of thousands of other potential custoemrs</p>
