<p>After using the iPad this week, the one weakness I have found is the lack of a good twitter app. I have tried quite a few so far and have only found a couple that are really worth using.
<h2>Missing In Action</h2>
<p><img title="hootsuite" height="49" alt="" width="187" class="alignleft" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8d0/1367697940801/hootsuite.jpg" />First, let me say I use <a href="http://hootsuite.com">HootSuite</a> at work, at home and on my iphone. I was disappointed to see they didn't make their app iPad friendly yet. They say it is on their radar. We will just have to wait and see what that means. I have to believe that they would have the best app hands down if it were out now.</p>
<h2>Not Keeping Up</h2>
<p>So that takes me back to what I used prior to HootSuite, which was <a href="http://www.tweetdeck.com/">TweetDeck</a>. TweetDeck was the dominant twitter app for a long time. So, I figured it would be the one app on the iPad I could use. Unfortunately I was wrong. The app is painfully slow. It shows two lists in portrait mode and three in landscape mode. Each list loads or refreshes one at a time and seems to take more than 30 seconds each time. Plus, I personally can't stand the Black theme anymore. I don't need a bunch of shiny black boxes. It starts to look like my twitter feed is built out of legos.</p>
<h2>Old Reliable</h2>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8d3/1367697942389/twitterific.png"><img title="twitterific" height="96" alt="" width="96" class="alignleft" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8d8/1367697940897/twitterific-150x150.png" /></a></p>
<p>I then found <a href="http://twitterrific.com/">Twitterrific</a>, another app from the early iPhone days. It is straight forward and has a very clean interface. It has all the features you would expect. Multiple accounts, twitter lists, trends and search.  However, you cannot add images or your location to your tweets.  If you want a clean twitter experience though, and nothing else, then Twitterrific is for you.</p>
<h2>Best So Far</h2>
<p>When searching for a twitter app, you quickly get tired of all the variations of the word tweet and tend to stick with what you know, hence the  choices above.  So right as I was about to give up and settle, I came across what I think is currently the best Twitter app for the iPad at the moment. That app is <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweettime-twitter-client/id324605537?mt=8">TweetTime</a> for iPad.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8e2/1367697942152/tweetime1.jpg"><img title="tweetime1" height="96" alt="" width="96" class="alignleft" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8e5/1367697940898/tweetime1-150x150.jpg" /></a><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/tweettime-twitter-client/id324605537?mt=8">TweetTime</a> has all the features Twitteriffic has plus some key features that make it a step above. First, you ave all the basics, multiple accounts, lists, trends and search. But you also get a integrated web browser for viewing links. You can email and retweet from this browser and navigate wherever you like, not just to the link from a tweet.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8e8/1367697942289/tweettime2.jpg"><img title="tweettime2" height="96" alt="" width="96" class="alignright" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/51855200e4b0580e000a606c/518569efe4b04b094756d5e2/51856a12e4b04b094756d8eb/1367697940888/tweettime2-150x150.jpg" /></a>Another great feature is Near By tweets. By allowing the app to get your current location, you get a map with local tweets popping up as they happen. I have seen this on the iphone, but the larger screen means more real estate to cover and just makes it a better experience than the phone.</p>
<p>When sending tweets, you can add your location, images and shortened urls.  This by far seems to be the best app so far, but I am sure the app sore will be flooded with every possible variation of the twitter experience soon. So I suggest getting used to one of these apps and stop looking or you will go broke trying app after app that does the same thing as the apps above.</p>
<p>What is your favorite iPad Twitter App?</p>
