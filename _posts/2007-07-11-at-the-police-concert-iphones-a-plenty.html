It's been a couple of years since I have been to a big concert.  I think the last one was The Eagles a few years ago.  Well things have changed since then.  Everyone, and I mean everyone, was taking pictures with digital cameras, smart phones and yes, iPhones.  I counted 3 iPhones just in the row in front of me and behind me.  Walking out, I saw quite a few.  The interesting thing was, on the way out, everyone I saw with one was showing them to someone else.  They are real conversation starters.  These are the first I have seen in person, and they are much thinner than I thought, and much smaller than my, suddenly so old looking, <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/cell-phone-details/?device=AT%26T+8525&amp;q_sku=sku970003">Cingular 8525</a>.</p>
<p>I also found out my <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/cell-phone-details/?device=AT%26T+8525&amp;q_sku=sku970003">8525's</a> camera sucks.  I was watching a girl in front of me taking pictures at 15x zoom with a tiny digital camera and she could have been 25 feet from the stage buy the looks of the pictures she was getting.  My pictures were at regular zoom and they... they just sucked (see below).  Needles to say, after seeing the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/miniscobleizer/">photos that the iPhone is capable of taking</a>, I am one step closer to changing phones when they come out with the next version.</p>
