<p><a href="http://www.pownce.com" target="_blank">Pownce.com</a> is this week's darling of the Web 2.0 World.  Released recently as a closed beta, invites seem to have been very easy to come by.  I have checked it out and must say the layout and features are far more advanced than <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.  That being said, I think there are a few holes that need filling.</p>
<p>One thing I used Twitter for the most was the SMS messaging.  Now maybe that is not as important as I think it is, but to me, that is one of the main reasons for using Twitter.  I don't want to sit with another web page open all day to see what my friends are doing and I don't want my email filling up (a bad feature which I hope they change).  I use Twitter to follow friends primarily when I am away from my computer.  I realize, this is going to take some $$$ for Pownce get going, but without it, I think too many people will continue to use Twitter and won't make the switch.</p>
<p>Second, where's the Web 2.0 ajax goodness??  Sure there's some ajax sprinkled throughout, but I would expect something big from the guys who brought us the early Ajax wonder Digg Spy.  Where's the auto updating timeline?  I want to see messages and links fading in on the top of my list.</p>
<p>Truth is I am sure the guys and girls at Pownce.com are holding their cards close to their vest.  They are bound to have some good features under the covers yet to be shown.  And hey, they can afford to sit back and roll this out slow and smart.  The competition is slow to add anything and will have a hard time fighting the Digg Effect when it starts rolling.</p>
<p>If you're on Pownce already, <a href="http://www.pownce.com/bennewton/" target="_blank">add me as a friend</a>.</p>
