<p><a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/10/reducing_fear_i.html%22%3EHere%3C/a">Here</a> is an amazing story that proves great customer service does not have to take place in a retail setting.  Whether it's a doctors office or a department store or a phone call from a mortgage company trying to sell you something, I think we all could learn from the Doctor in this story.  It may be another customer of the plenty you will see today, but to them, you are the only one they are seeing or talking to.</p>
