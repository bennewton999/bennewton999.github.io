<p>Facebook announced their much anticipated "gmail killer" today.  However, it seems to be closer to Google Wave than Google Mail.  So, where is the new messaging?  Well, it's being brought out slowly via an invite only system.  I don't know if this is to test the system or create a buzz to get people to use it.
This is what I have found where you can get on the official list to be invited.</p>
<p>Go to <a class="vt-p" href="http://www.facebook.com/about/messages/">this page</a> and click the green button on the bottom right to get on the list.</p>
