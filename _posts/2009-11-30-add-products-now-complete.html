<p>The “add catalog” section of the app is complete.  A little more involved than I planned, but that’s a good thing.  I’m very happy with the way it has turned out.  Tomorrow, I hope to do a video to show you a walk through of the adding products process.  It will give you a better idea of what can be done with the app.</p>
<p>Once I have run it through it’s paces for a day or two, I plan on opening up beta testing.  At that point, I will add feature after feature to the edit section of the app.  There is an endless number of features I can add and I am sure there will be plenty I haven’t even thought of.  So please <a href="http://getsatisfaction.com/webtocatalog">leave feedback</a>.  Tell me what you like and what you don’t like.</p>
