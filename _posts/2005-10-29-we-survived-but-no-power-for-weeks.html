<p>We survived the storm.  Here it is almost a week later and we have no power and we probably won't for a couple of more weeks.  The storm was worse than anyone predicted.  There is damage from the keys to Vero Beach.  I know, because the Tuesday after the storm, I drove all the way to Vero to pick up generators.
The damage is not as bad as Andrew, but there is more than Andrew.  Much more.  There are trees snapped everywhere. Not down, snapped.  Huge trees.  There are ficuses and pines, that are old enough to have seen a lot of storms that are snapped like twigs.</p>
<p>At our house, we lost a ton of trees.  Luckily there was no damage to the house except for the screen enclosure is gone.  We were blocked in for a couple of days due to trees down in the streets.  Luckily, my wife is smarter than me and we were very prepared.  Plenty of food and water.  We still have not had to go shopping.</p>
<p>I will post more when I get power back.  Next month :(.</p>
