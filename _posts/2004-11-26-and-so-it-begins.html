<p>Today is the largest shopping day of the year, and from the looks of <a href="http://www.theboxtank.com/walmartbox/2004/11/black_friday_ar.html" target="_blank">these pictures</a>, I think online shopping is still the way to go... Although I have found myself less likely to buy things online any more. The fun has worn off. I was an Amazon junkie a few years ago. I still have a shopping cart on amazon with about 20 books I will probably never read, that I added 4 years ago..
Now, I don't have the paitience for online shopping. The only way I shop online is if I can't get something locally. But with the Holiday Season here, and South Florida being a crazy place to shop during this season, I will probably be online 3 or 4 days before Christmas FedExing in my wife's gifts. Maybe I should try shopping next week.. Who am I kidding.</p>
