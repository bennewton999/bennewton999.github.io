<p><span style="color: #ff0000;">*** THIS POST IS DEAD ALONG WITH GOOGLE WAVE ***</span>
I am testing Google Wave's embed feature to see if this is something I can use later on for demos or support.  Tell me what you think in the wave below.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  It doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Now it's working!  Not quite sure why the background is green.  Hopefully I will figure that out before you see it.</p>
<p>Some issues I ran into were:</p>
<ul>
<li>unable to decipher correct wave id.  Finally found good directions at <a href="http://tuto-wave.com/google-wave/how-to-add-google-wave-to-wordpress" target="_blank">Tuto Wave</a></li>
<li>height for wavr plugin apparently needs 'px' at the end of each value.  Though it looked like it worked without it on other sites.</li>
</ul>
<p>There were more, but I was so sure it was not going to work, I didn't keep track.</p>
<p>Take  a look below and give me your take on Google Wave embeds.  So far, I think it's too messy of on option.  By that, I mean waves seem to grow at a pace that becomes too hard to follow, even with the playback mode.  So let's see what the Wave below does.</p>
<p>[wave id="googlewave.com!w+vW9909euA" color="#000000" bgcolor="#ffffff" font="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" font_size="12" width="600px" height="400px"]</p>
