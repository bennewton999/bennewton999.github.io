<p>As a developer since 1996, I have dealt with my share of writing web apps so they work well with different browsers.  This has cost countless hours of unnecessary work.  If the standard was followed, we may all be a little further along now.
Now, with <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> opening up its API and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/06/29/myspace-likely-to-open-platform-to-3rd-party-developers/trackback/">word of MySpace</a> and <a href="http://mashable.com/2007/07/20/bebo-developers/">others soon doing the same</a>,  are we going to be writing apps that not only work in different web browsers, but with different social websites too?  Will we soon be making sure we have apps for all the social networks as each one becomes the next "shiny object"?  And if so, is this a good thing, or a bad thing?  If you're a company that has to pay for these different apps to be developed, I guess it's not so good, but if your a developer, you better keep up with the changes that are coming, it may get busier...</p>
