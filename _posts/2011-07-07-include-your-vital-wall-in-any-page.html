You can now include your Vital Wall in any webpage.  With a few lines of javascipt, turn any div into your vital wall.  I will be posting examples up soon how to add a live window so to speak into your ecommerce site.  I have added it to a bigcommerce.com site and it works great.  You can allow customers to see what other customers are browsing live.  Imagine if there is a popular item in your store, now your customers can see the "crowd" in that aisle.  Watch for more details and examples.</p>
